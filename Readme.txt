# Users-Dashboard

## Installation


Usage
configure the .env file

```bash
npm i
front: npm run start
server: npm run start 
```

## Missing parts:

Haven't provided unit test

## What would I do differently:

-I would use more libraries to handle for example input validation

-I would create a more secure auth mechanism with refresh tokens.

-I would handle more validation to display messages to the users
